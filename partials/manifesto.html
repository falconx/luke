				<h2>The Work</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Whether its culture, fashion, lifestyles, media, technology or even peoples words and actions, we are all consumers. As a designer,
					I feel that I have a responsibility to respond to this.</p>
					<p>Through visual means, sampling, remixing, criticizing, sympathizing, experimenting, I want to produce work that is both critical,
					challenging and relevant to today's culture.</p>
